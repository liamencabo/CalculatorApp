Project - Calculator App in C#

As the name suggest this is a calculator app written in C#, I've always liked calculator apps since they are one of the easiest projects to learn/create but also gives you an in-depth work of the language you are using to be comfortable enough to tackle the more complex aspects of the language you are learning and for more challenging projects!
